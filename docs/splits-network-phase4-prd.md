# Splits Network – Phase 4 PRD (Platform Expansion, Network Effects & Defensibility)

Phase 4 begins after:
- Phase 3 payouts, automation infrastructure, and trust controls are live
- The marketplace operates with minimal manual intervention
- Economics, ownership, and payouts are stable under real volume

Phase 4 is not about adding features.
Phase 4 is about locking in network effects, expanding surfaces, and making Splits Network hard to replace.
